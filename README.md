### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bavo Knol, I enjoy making websites using mostly Nuxt.js, Node and Laravel nowadays.

## **My career**

**Education**

 - ROC Flevoland MBO 4: Software developer

	- I finished this in October of 2021, a bit ahead of schedule so I took a gap year where I focused on improving my skills while working

- Hoge School Utrecht: HBO-ICT
	- I'm doing my batchlors here, I'm currently not specialized in anything but I've mostly been doing backend dev and a little bit of server stuff

 

**Work**

- 2021: Jaspers media full stack developer

	- I started here as an intern and was offered a job after that to keep working there part time.

I took a little gap year in 2022 to learn some new skills and work for a year while I wait to be able to join my HBO

## **Hobbies**

I enjoy watching anime in my free time, read some Manga, play some Valorant with my friends and ofcourse trying to realize one of the bajillion projects I start.
